This randomizer has three flags.
    e  Randomize entrances/exits - unsafe.
    i  Randomize item pickups.
    m  Randomize enemies.

Some notes about entrance randomization:
    -Randomizing entrances and exits may make the game uncompletable. The randomizer does naively attempt to connect everything together, but there are still cases where it may make mistakes.
    -Entrances and exits are only randomized within a given stage.
    -Death warping may take you to unexpected locations.
    -If you select this flag, you are guaranteed to find a Missile and a Rope pickup in the first stage.
